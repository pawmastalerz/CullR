# CullR

CullR helps you clean up your photo library quickly. You swipe through your
photos and videos, choose what to keep or delete, and only confirm deletions
at the end.

## What it does

- Review photos and videos one by one
- Swipe right to keep, left to delete
- Undo recent swipes
- Preview items in full screen
- Review your Keep and Delete lists before taking action
- Works in multiple languages

## How it handles your photos

CullR reads your photos and videos only to show them to you. Everything happens
on your device. Your media never leaves your phone.

If you decide to delete items, the app will ask for confirmation first.

## Privacy policy

- CullR does not collect, store, or transmit personal data.
- There is no account system and no analytics or advertising.
- All photo and video access stays on-device.
- No media is uploaded or shared.

## Permissions

CullR asks for access to your photo library so it can show you your photos and
videos. If you deny access, the app will show you how to open system settings
and grant it later.

## External links

The app includes a link to Buy Me a Coffee. If you open it, your browser may
share data with that site under their privacy policy.
